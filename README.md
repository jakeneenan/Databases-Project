# Who cares about federal judges?

This is my final project for Data and Databases, Fall 2022. It involves scraping data from the internet, cleaning and standardizing it, and doing some basic analysis.

## Data

The data was scraped from the Senate Judiciary Committee website. It includes the name of every federal judge nominee the committee reviewed and the names of every organization and person who submitted a brief in support of each nominee since late 2020 (when the committee first started posting this on their website).
