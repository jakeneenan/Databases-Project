# Who cares about federal judges?

This is my final project for Data and Databases, Fall 2022. It involves scraping data from the internet, cleaning and standardizing it, and doing some basic analysis. The end result is a look at some of the organizations that have a vested interest in the makeup of federal courts in the United States.

## Data

The data was scraped from the Senate Judiciary Committee website. It includes the name of every federal judge nominee and every organization that submitted a brief in support of each nominee, starting in late 2020 (when the committee first started posting this information on their website).


## Output

After some cleaning and compiling I exported the scraped data to a csv file. You can look at it [here](https://github.com/jakeneenan/databases-project/files/10439108/orgs.csv).

## Contact

If you are at all interested in this and would like me to me make an auto-updating version of this, scrape some additional information, etc., please don't hesitate to reach out! I would be more than happy to do so.
